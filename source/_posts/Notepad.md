Whether it's notes, PRD or huge documents. I start my first draft on a notepad.
I choose good old notepad, ignoring many other tools. Why?

I've my own reasons.

### Zero distraction

No red underline or word suggestions. Focus completely on writing.
### Wide canvas

One of the best thing about using notepad is the wide writing area. You are not limited by page size.
### Small font
Small font, more content on screen. See the big picture while writing.
### Consolas

Notepad font, aka consolas. It's classy and sharp. 
One can feel the power of words while typing.
### Less clutter

What is FBW, [Fast Bad Wrong](http://email.aliabdaal.com/issues/the-acronym-that-changed-how-i-write-188247)?  I got this idea from Youtuber / Doctor [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/c/aliabdaal/featured).

Later, make it perfect.**

Notepad is great place write your first draft. 
Draft on a notepad, later transfer to docs or somewhere to do the clean-up.

Usually, I use ResophNotes to write my drafts.  It's the best variant of notepad. I strongly suggest you give [ResophNotes](https://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html) a try.

I'll write about this tool later. 

A serious warning for guys who wish to write on a notepad. Notepad has no option to autosave.

If you're not saving notes frequently, there's a high chance you'll lose the notes.
